    "Python is a general-purpose programming language, and you can do pretty much anything in Python! However, there are many functionalities that Python is particularly useful for, thanks to open source *libraries*. A few that are relevant to data-driven decision making are given below:\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Analyze and visualize data using libraries like `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`.\n",
    "- **Machine learning**: Python is extremely versatile for ML tasks, including classical ML (in `scikit-learn`) and interfaces to commonly used deep learning libraries (e.g. `tensorflow`, `XGBoost`)\n",
    "- **Optimisation**: Solve solutions to complex problems using libraries like `scipy.optimize` and ``\n",
    "- **Simulation**: Create large-scale simulations, including agent-based models (`Mesa`) and traffic microsimulation (`SUMO`).\n",
    "- **Web Development**: Interact with ild websites and web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask.\n",
